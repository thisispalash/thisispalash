### ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=thisispalash.thisispalash) ðŸ‘‹ hunlo !!

Welcome to my github ! I will keep updating the two to three current repositories that I am working on (and (soon) recently released projects) in this file. Other than that, most of my time is likely spent leaving myself messages across time. I try to maintain a comprehensive list of project activity on github, which you can find [here](https://github.com/thisispalash/index) (not updated yet). Feel free to browse around, and do let me know if some project helped you out on Twitter !!

## recent releases

- [Semicolon Fingers](https://github.com/thisispalash/semicolon) :: Mint heartwarming stories with a semicolon tattoo as an NFT. The idea behind this project is to relate moods and colours in an effort to raise awareness about mental health. A small MVP released over the course of a [hackathon](https://showcase.ethglobal.com/roadtoweb3/semicolon-fingers), with plans to turn it into a full fleged project by Q4 2023.
- [Rally Gatr](https://github.com/thisispalash/rally-calendly) :: A token gated calendar access to book timeslots with your favorite creator. Built as a [bounty submission](https://gitcoin.co/issue/27686) for Rally.

## work in progress

- [Buddle Protocol](https://github.com/Buddle-finance/buddle-protocol) :: A next gen cross layer2 bridge allowing for near instant token transfers across multiple layer2 blockchains. Inspired by [this post by @vitalik](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/cross_layer_2_bridges).
- [Curation DAO](https://github.com/thisispalash/curationDAO) :: A concept of a curation DAO written over the course of the [Tezos hackathon on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/WAC/onboard).
