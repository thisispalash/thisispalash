### 👋 hello!

Welcome to my github! Here, you may find all code that enables my life. Larger projects are made into organisations (especially DAO material), but most personal code and code yet to be decentralised can be found under my repositories. As of now, I am applying for grants in the web3 space for some of my projects, and also competing in the amazing hackathons happening globally! If you'd like a more user friendly version of my life, you can head on over to [my site](https://thisispalash.com/) (may be incomplete).

Current Projects I am working on -
- 🐒  [`Dash Mon[k]ey`](https://dash-monkey.com/) — manage your web3 money in a web3 way!
- 💭  [`Dapp Ideas`](https://dapp-ideas.github.io/) - a non-fungible way to crowdfund questioning.

Future Projects (that I am setting up) -
- 🧠  Artificially Assisted Symbiotic Intelligence [AASI]
- 👻  See A Shrink? Sure. [SASS]

Ultra Future Projects (that I am exploring) -
- 🗺  The World iF
- 🍁  Gateway

All in all the projects follow the common theme of radical self suffiency to enable true, free actualisation. The first step, imo, is to decentralise the world, one bit at a time - Radical Democracy!
