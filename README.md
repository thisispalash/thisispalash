### 👋 hello!

Welcome to my github! Here, you may find all code that enables my life. Larger projects are made into organisations (especially DAO material), but most personal code and code yet to be decentralised can be found under my repositories. As of now, I am applying for grants in the web3 space for some of my projects, and also competing in the amazing hackathons happening globally! If you'd like a more user friendly version of my life, you can head on over to [my site](https://thisispalash.com/) (may be incomplete).

Current Projects, I am working on -
- 🐒  [`Dash Mon[k]ey`](https://dashmonkey.art/) - manage your web3 money in a web3 way!
- 💭  [`Dapp Ideas`](https://dappideas.art/) - a non-fungible way to crowdfund questioning.
- 👻  [`AASI -- SASS`](https://web3guru.art/) - Artificially Assisted Symbiotic Intelligence -- See A Shrink? Sure.

Fun Side Projects -
- [`tampopo [dot] eth`](https://thisispalash.com/tampopo/) - A storytelling platform rewarding you for enrapturing your audience
- personas - a social media manager with chatbots for 24x7 connectivity, but with sanity
- memerPRO - cut and stitch videos for compelling custom narratives
- ethBier - a global connoisseur community, spirits and soul !
- jaquis - Just Another QUite Interesting System

Ultra Future Projects, that I am exploring -
- 🤔 [`The World iF`](https://web3world.art/) - web3 existed from the get go; ie, the world if we all lived in a globally connected, actualised society, and played positive sum games
- 🍁 [`Gateway`](https://web3gateway.art/) - is decentralsed, modular hemp production the key to space travel?

All in all the projects follow the common theme of radical self suffiency to enable true, free, accessible actualisation. The first step, imo, is to decentralise the world, one bit at a time - Radical Democracy! And now we actually can !!
