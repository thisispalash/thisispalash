### ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=thisispalash.thisispalash) üëã hello !!

Welcome to my github! Here, you may find all code that enables my life. Larger projects are made into organisations (especially DAO material), but most personal code and code yet to be decentralised can be found under my repositories. As of now, I am applying for grants in the web3 space for some of my projects, and also competing in the amazing hackathons happening globally! If you'd like a more user friendly version of my life, you can head on over to [my site](https://thisispalash.com/) (may be incomplete) or [the github index](https://github.com/thisispalash/lists) (may also be incomplete).


## web3 Convenience
> full fledged DAOs with long*ish* term involvement

These projects are effectively [solo] organisations, aimed at creating _extremely_ helpful networks. They were all typically born out of personal necessity, and are made open (and scalable) in the hopes of others having similar necessities. The goal of these _projects_ is also to enable a truly actualised society, because if not in the 21st century, then when?

  Let a virtual pet manage your finances, while you rest assured that you will always have *enough*. Learn new skills with your pet, and feed them healthy diets so they remain healthy. The idea is to take the emotion out of money, so you may use your time for other things, better things.

  Employ true, powerful decentralisation to find kindred spirits and collobrate worldwide. The idea or the question is the most important, rank, clout, skill can always be gained. The magic of cryptocurrencies and the internet dissipates all barriers to previously, ferociously, gated communities. Now anyone may create a grant, for whatever purpose, and be funded or find collaborators to fulfill that grant.

  Can everybody have their very own jarvis, without a Wall-E future? Upskilling with accessible knowledge, personalised rnd, and _positive sum_ incentives may let everyone actualise like Tony, rather than the ***dense*** _customers_ of the Buy and Large Corporation. The idea is to have a true personal manager and companion who assists you in and reminds you of tasks, and also is a resource for general conversation and _learning_, mostly through humour, sarcasm, and ___memes___

## Fun Side Projects
> Built over a hackathon, or a weekend, or just for fun

These projects are smaller term projects, typically worked on for less than three months. Sometimes I would go back to a project, in case of a _fun_ update, but generally, _out of mind, out of sight_. Moreover, most of these project do not have scope for active development post the few weeks or months as these are typically small games, simple protocols, or copypasta (of the idea more than code, but also code). Many of the projects are also simplay backlogged projects that I was unwilling to let go. Having said that, the projects are archived [read: abandoned] after a working release is pushed, (with docs, for my future sanity more than yours).

The blockchain bug has bitten me, and why wouldn't it? it gives the internet an economy! Oh the possibilities ..
