## 👋 Hello, internet people!
<!-- just wanted to [say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_AFc_BXht4) [thanks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbdRIVCBqNI)! -->

I'm raising funds to build _Sliver Labs_, a company I've been dreaming about for years. If you're interested in supporting experimental Web3 projects, let's talk: [Email me](mailto:pa334@cornell.edu) | [𝕏](https://x.com/theprimefibber)  

## About Sliver Labs
Sliver Labs is an attempt to bring some structure to the internet’s growing sprawl. The goal isn’t just to build another platform, but to explore ways of making decentralized networks more **usable, interconnected, and human-centric**. (Isn't it time we have some _real_ projects in crypto?)

The approach is to start with standalone dApps that solve real problems, self-contained but loosely coupled. Right now, that means building:  

- [Semicolon Fingers](https://semicolonfingers.com/) – A storytelling platform aimed at addressing the global loneliness epidemic..
- [Dash Mon\[k\]ey](https://dashmonkey.xyz/) – An onchain embodiment of your (financial) health, in the form of a pet monkey!

More details soon. Sign up on the sites above for updates, or follow me on [𝕏](https://x.com/theprimefibber).
