### ![](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=thisispalash.thisispalash) 👋 hello !!

Welcome to my github ! I will keep updating the two to three current repositories that I am working on (and perhaps recently released projects) in this file. Other than that, most of my time is likely spent in working on the web3 networks listed below. You can contact me using my [website](https://thisispalash.com/) or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/isthispalash). I also try to maintain a comprehensive list of project activity on github, which you can find [here](https://github.com/thisispalash/index). Feel free to browse around, and do let me know if some project helped you out!

## longterm web3 protocols

These projects are effectively solo*ish* organisations, aimed at creating extremely _helpful_ networks. They were all typically born out of personal necessity, and are made open (and scalable) in case of others having similar necessities. The goal of these _networks_ is ultimately to enable a truly actualised society, because if not in the 21st century, then when?

  [`web3tamagotchi`](https://github.com/web3tamagotchi "dash mon[k]ey") :
  Let a virtual pet manage your finances, while you rest assured that you will always have *enough*. Learn new skills with your pet, and feed them healthy diets so they remain healthy. The idea is to take the emotion out of money, so you may use your time for other things, better things.

  [`web3science`](https://github.com/web3science "dapp ideas") :
  Employ true, powerful decentralisation to find kindred spirits and collobrate worldwide. The idea or the question is the most important, rank, clout, skill can always be gained. The magic of cryptocurrencies and the internet dissipates all barriers to previously, ferociously, gated communities. Now anyone may create a grant, for whatever purpose, and be funded or find collaborators to fulfill that grant.

  [`web3jaquip`](https://github.com/web3jaquip "jarvis | jaquis")
  Can everybody have their very own jarvis, without a Wall-E future? Upskilling with accessible knowledge, personalised rnd, and _positive sum_ incentives may let everyone actualise like Tony, rather than the ***dense*** _customers_ of the Buy and Large Corporation. The idea is to have a true personal manager and companion who assists you in and reminds you of tasks, and also is a resource for general conversation and _learning_, mostly through humour, sarcasm, and ___memes___
